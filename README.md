# Numerical Methods in MATLAB
Various problems in Numerical Methods are coded in MATLAB. You can find the codes in the code folder. The hybrid PSO folder is for solving unknown boundary value differential equation problems. The Project Euler folder contains codes for the problems from https://projecteuler.net .


Numerical computing is an approach for solving complex mathematical models which represent some physical phenomena. With the advancements in computation now we can solve complex models right in our personal computers just by writing a few lines of code. Technicality comes in picture when we try to solve complex problems in a reasonable time with minimal error.

The module assumes only basic programming knowledge (in any language) and some background in partial differential equations, ordinary differential equations, fluid mechanics, Algebra, and basic math.
