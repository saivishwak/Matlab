# Numerical Method Codes in MATLAB
Various problems in Numerical Methods are coded in MATLAB. You can find the codes in he code reprository. The hybrid PSO reprository is for solving unkown boundary value differential equation probelms. The Project Euler resprository contains codes for the problems from https://projecteuler.net .
